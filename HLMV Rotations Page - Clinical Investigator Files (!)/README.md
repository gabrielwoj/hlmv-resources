This pack adds a bit of Medic's lower coat so some cosmetic items don't look off with paint variants. This, however, is not perfect, as some small areas of the model will appear missing. Although, this is not the case when using these exact angle values:

Rot: (28.393925 -41.925488 -23.125006)
Trans: (103.000000 1.000000 51.000000)

So, it should only be used when using these values. Of course that for items that focus on the back of the Medic, the missing areas will be apparent, so do not use this for items like that.
