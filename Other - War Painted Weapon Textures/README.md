Includes .dds files for War Painted / Decorated Weapons of each grade and each weapon, as well converted .VTFs, ready to use on HLMV. Every texture was taken with the seed set to "0".

---

Instructions:

There are two folders, one for "Decorated" weapons and another for "War Painted" weapons. Inside either one of those folders contains a collection. A collection consists of all available weapons available to that "theming".

Inside the Collection folder, all available weapons for that skin will be available as folders. On Decorated Weapons, only a select few are there, while War Painted weapons show every single war-paintable weapon (except for the Dragon Slayer Collection).

Skins that are team-colored include a folder for the RED team, and another for the BLU team. Note that the vast majority of skinnable weapons only include 1 skin, so you'll have to switch the Skin on HLMV if necessary. Weapons that include team-colors, will use their _blue.vtf and _blue.vmt filenames instead. The following weapons follow this rule:

- Flame Thrower;

- Degreaser;

- Detonator;

- Powerjack;

- Claidheamh Mòr;

- Rescue Ranger;

- Crusader's Crossbow;

- Medi Gun;

- Ubersaw*;

- Amputator

Note: Every single War Paint for the Ubersaw will include RED and BLU variants since the Uber meter stays team-colored, even if the war paint is neutral-colored.

Extract the "war_paints_folder_tree_and_necessary_files.zip" file onto tf/custom, so you have the entire folder tree you'll be working on, alongside getting rid of jigglebones on jiggleboned weapons, and the pilotlight animation.

Now, it's just a matter of dragging and dropping the .VTF and .VMT files onto tf/custom/materials, following the proper folder tree for each weapon.

The model Rotation values (lightrot, Rot and Trans), alongside the proper FOV value, and each model path, can be located here: https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:Gabrielwoj/Sandbox3
