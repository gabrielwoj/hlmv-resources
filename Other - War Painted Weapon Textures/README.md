Includes .dds files for War Painted / Decorated Weapons of each grade and each weapon, as well converted .VTFs, ready to use on HLMV. Every texture was taken with the seed set to "0".

---

Instructions:

There are two folders, one for "Decorated" weapons and another for "War Painted" weapons. Inside either one of those folders contains a collection. A collection consists of all available weapons available to that "theming".

Inside the Collection folder, all available weapons for that skin will be available as folders. On Decorated Weapons, only a select few are there, while War Painted weapons show every single war-paintable weapon (except for the Dragon Slayer Collection).

Skins that are team-colored include a folder for the RED team, and another for the BLU team. Note that the vast majority of skinnable weapons only include 1 skin, so you'll have to switch the Skin on HLMV if necessary. Weapons that include team-colors, will use their _blue.vtf and _blue.vmt filenames instead. The following weapons follow this rule:

- Flame Thrower;

- Degreaser;

- Detonator;

- Powerjack;

- Claidheamh Mòr;

- Rescue Ranger;

- Crusader's Crossbow;

- Medi Gun;

- Ubersaw*;

- Amputator.

Note: Every single War Paint for the Ubersaw will include RED and BLU variants since the Uber meter stays team-colored, even if the war paint is neutral-colored.

Extract the "war_paints_folder_tree_and_necessary_files.zip" file onto tf/custom, so you have the entire folder tree you'll be working on, alongside getting rid of jigglebones on jiggleboned weapons, and the pilotlight animation.

Now, it's just a matter of dragging and dropping the .VTF and .VMT files onto tf/custom/materials, following the proper folder tree for each weapon.

The model Rotation values (lightrot, Rot and Trans), alongside the proper FOV value, and each model path, can be located here: https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:Gabrielwoj/Sandbox3

My progress on extraction will be as follows:

1- First capture every single GPA Frame for each skin on every collection;

2- Then get the textures out of the GPA Frames;

3- After extracting them to DDS, move them to their appropriate folders;

4- After EVERYTHING is done, mass-import the .DDS files, and convert them to .VTF;

5- After that, PowerRename the .VTF files to change the folder name from "DDS" to "VTF";

6- Once all that is done, mass-rename every .dds and .vtf file with their internal filenames. This will be done as the last thing, so I can mass-rename everything by searching for "Air Strike" and renaming all .dds and .vtf files to "c_atom_launcher", for instance.

War Paints:

Note: War Paints will only be uploaded to the repository once the entire collection is done (textures converted to VTF, and exteriors moved to their proper folders). However, file names won't be renamed until ALL War Paints are complete (GPA frames taken, textures exported, converted DDS to VTF, and moved to proper folders). This is because I will be doing a mass rename later that will be much easier once everyting is done.

Misc.:

Obtained all material_overrides (VMTs): Complete;

Organized folder tree: Complete;

Removed jigglebones from certain weapons: Complete;

Check if team-colored weapons have any differences on their VMTs. If the difference is noticeable enough, then, single-color War Paints will require previews on both teams: Complete;

- The only weapon with a difference outside the Ubersaw is Detonator's projectile, but the weapon itself VMTs are identical on both teams.

Re-check what War Paints use the Grenade Launcher and Loose Cannon specific VMTs: Incomplete;

Fix for Bazaar Bargain's .VMTs that were introduced in later patches (fix broken UV mapping on _lens.vmt): Complete

- Valve simply got rid of material_override for the Bazaar Bargain's War Paints. Technically, the bug is still there, but no War Paint is using a material_override anymore.
