Fixes "File *modelpath*" doesn't exist error while trying to load any model via "(Steam) Load Model..." on HLMV.

This pack simply contains every single folders from the model files, and nothing else, no model files, no textures, nothing at all other than empty folders. HLMV has a problem locating the folder paths, but this pack fix it.

Currently a Work-In-Progress. I (@gabrielwoj) don't know how to upload hundreds of thousands of empty folders on GitHub. There's work-arounds, but I'm still struggling trying to get it done.
