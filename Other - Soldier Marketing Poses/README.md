The Marketing Poses were removed by Valve around the Scream Fortress 2013 update. This pack contains old animation files for the Soldier that contains those poses. Keep in mind that
this was obtained from a TF2 mod on Gamebanana, called "The Samurai Soldier Pack", made by Populus89. While the mod focuses in a new set for the Soldier, with weapons and cosmetics,
the mod also includes a new taunt, which in this case, includes old animation files that still contains the Marketing Poses.

The mod can be found here: http://tf2.gamebanana.com/skins/86800

This pack does not have intention to redistribute the pack by Populus89 (as it only contains the animation files on it), only for sharing the old Marketing Poses that TF2 had.

To go back to the original/default animations for TF2, remove the "Other - Soldier Marketing Poses" folder/.vpk from your custom folder.
