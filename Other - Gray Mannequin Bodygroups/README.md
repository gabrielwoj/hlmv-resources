Original made by NeoDement.

This is not needed to work on images for the Wiki, and it doesn't fix anything on HLMV. This is a pack that has each class model have several types of bodygroups, as well completely gray and invisible textures. These were used to make the Item Icons in Shugo style.

Why don't I link the original source instead? Well, there was an error with the Demoman's vest bodygroup on his model files, so I fixed it. Although, fixing that broke his only working eye (poor lad), so I'll leaving both original and modified models. One or another may be better depending on the Item icon you may do.

This doesn't really need to go in "Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom", you can put it anywhere, but we recommend placing on custom for convenience when loading via "Load Model..."
