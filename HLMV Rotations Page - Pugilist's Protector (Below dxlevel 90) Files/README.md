This pack includes both "heavy_head_materials" and two modified .vmts for the Pugilist's Protector cosmetic.

The "heavy_head_materials" part was originally made by Omolong, while Gabrielwoj worked on the modified Pugilist's Protector .vmts.

This will change the basetexture to use the "_dx8.vtf" version, which is in fact used when TF2 is being run in a dxlevel lower than 90.
