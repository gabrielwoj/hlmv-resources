Instructions:

Load props/trainyard/cart_base_separate.mdl as your main model.

Load these as submodels:

props_2fort/lantern001_off.mdl
props_halloween/pumpkin_explode.mdl
props_halloween/pumpkin_explode2.mdl
props_halloween/pumpkin_explode3.mdl
props_halloween/pumpkin_explode4.mdl
props_halloween/pumpkin_explode5.mdl
props_halloween/pumpkin_explode6.mdl
props_manor/chair_01.mdl
props_manor/vase_01.mdl
props_tumb/halloween/thief_pumpkin_x20.mdl

Close HLMV.

Open Registry Editor.

Use this Trans value:
(5350.992188 -2075.000000 4594.868164)

Because of how this was achieved, the location of the main model, cart_base_separate.mdl, had to be put very far away, as it was based on the exact values used on pl_bloodwater.
Be very gentle when rotating your model, as it will rotate very drastically. You can move the model as normal, however.
