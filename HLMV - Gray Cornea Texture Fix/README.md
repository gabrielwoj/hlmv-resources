Changes how bright the lightwrap texture for the class eyes, to fix an issue with HLMV that causes class' corneas to appear as gray, as instead of white. The issue happens mostly with NVIDIA graphics cards.

This should only be used if you are having that problem, if your HLMV shows the eyes just fine, do not download this one, otherwise the eyes will be more bright than normal.
