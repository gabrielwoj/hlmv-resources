This will remove some vertices featured on the Pyro Shark that "attaches" to the Pyro's model, only leaving the "burst" area (the one that is team-colored), and the shark head itself.

This also includes 2 .vmts that makes Pyro's RED and BLU textures invisible. The paint variants for the Pyro Shark were made by loading the Pyro Shark model as a "weapon" to Pyro's model.
