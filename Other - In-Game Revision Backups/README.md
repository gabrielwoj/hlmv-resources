This is an on-going archival project to preserve old revisions of cosmetics, weapons, and other types of visuals from TF2, in a way that is easily accessible and doesn't require to download an entire depot on Steam.

Due to how the distribution system on Steam changed when Steampipe hit, this project can only reach until 17 April 2013, the oldest patch that is possible to download the depot from.

Some examples of this project include cosmetic items that had model or texture differences made in a patch. The idea to archive only models (or textures) that had changes, so things that never had changes won't be on this project.

Note that these will use their old default path. Meaning that if you were to make mods using these, you'd need to update to their current file locations. A good way to know is by checking the items_game.txt and their model_path.
