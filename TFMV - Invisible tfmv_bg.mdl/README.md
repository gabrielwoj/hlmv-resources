Makes the tfmv_bg.mdl invisible, so changing backgrounds using Ctrl+B is now possible due to the lack of tfmv_bg.mdl. It's no longer needed to always unload the "weapon" when using TFMV for doing images.

.vpk is not available for this one as it does not work with it, only via "folders" on the custom folder.
