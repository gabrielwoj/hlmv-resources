This pack removes the clipping from Sniper's quiver that appears when his head is invisible. This, however, is not perfect, as some small areas of the model will appear missing. Although, this is not the case when using the consistent Sniper angle for shirt items, which is around:

Rot: (28.393925 -41.925488 -23.125006)
Trans: (103.000000 1.000000 51.000000)

So, it should only be used when using these values (the Trans value can be different, but the Rot value should be this one). Of course that for items that focus on the back of the Sniper, the missing areas will be apparent, so do not use this for items like that.
